# Introduction to Programmable Cryptography
Hello! I prepared [atomhacks2025.pdf](https://github.com/rizwankaz/atomhacks2025/blob/main/atomhacks.pdf) for a workshop I'm leading at Atomhacks 2025, a hackathon hosted at the Bronx High School of Science. It reviews [sha256.py](https://github.com/rizwankaz/atomhacks2025/blob/main/sha256.py), [keccak256.py](https://github.com/rizwankaz/atomhacks2025/blob/main/keccak256.py), and [blake2s.py](https://github.com/rizwankaz/atomhacks2025/blob/main/blake2s.py), each implementing the respective cryptographic hash function, fully independently, with as few libraries as possible. You can test each py file in the command line.

I intend to expand this to include Julia implementations as well.
